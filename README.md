# Stepwise-versus-Hierarchal-Regression
Regression analysis is an essential tool in data analysis for predicting the value of a dependent  variable based on one or more independent variables. Stepwise regression and hierarchical  regression are two widely used techniques in regression analysis. Stepwise regression is a 
technique that involves adding or removing variables to a model based on their statistical 
significance, while hierarchical regression is a technique that involves adding variables to a 
model in a specific order based on theoretical or practical considerations. Both methods have 
their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between the two depends on the research 
question and the underlying assumptions of the data.
This review paper provides an overview of stepwise regression and hierarchical regression and 
compares their advantages and disadvantages. We review the assumptions, advantages, and 
disadvantages of both techniques and discuss the factors that influence the choice of technique. 
We also highlight the potential problems associated with each technique and provide 
recommendations for their appropriate use. Overall, this review paper aims to help researchers 
and practitioners in selecting the most appropriate regression technique for their specific research question.
